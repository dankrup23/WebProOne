<p>In any K-12 classroom, beginning teachers, as well as those more experienced, 
may find that their students are not performing at the academic levels that are well within their capabilities. 
While there are many factors that determine an individual studentâ€™s performance, in addition to ways that a teacher 
can assist that student, one feature that every classroom must have is a well-managed learning environment. 
There is a classroom management strategy that is taught to educators in many school districts, and can be 
developed by any teacher, in any classroom. This is known as CHAMPS, which stands for 
Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, and Success.
