  <h4>Welcome Message</h4>

<p>In any K-12 classroom, beginning teachers, as well as those more experienced, may find that their students are not performing<br>
at the academic levels that are well within their capabilities. While there are many factors that determine an individual studentâ€™s <br>
performance, in addition to ways that a teacher can assist that student, one feature that every classroom must have is a well-managed <br>
learning environment. There is a classroom management strategy that is taught to educators in many school districts, and can be developed <br>
by any teacher, in any classroom. This is known as CHAMPS, which stands for: Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, <br>
and Success.
